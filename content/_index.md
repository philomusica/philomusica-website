      Our concerts in Spring 2025 will feature two great classics of the choral repertoire: <strong>Mozart’s great Mass in C minor</strong> and <strong>Vivaldi’s ever-popular Gloria</strong>. You can hear us perform these masterpieces at <strong>St Stephen’s, Barbourne, Worcester</strong> on <strong>Saturday 22 February</strong> (with organ accompaniment) or at <strong>St Philip & St James’ Church (‘Pip & Jim’s’), Leckhampton, Cheltenham</strong> on <strong>Saturday 1 March</strong> (with orchestra). Both concerts start at <strong>7.30pm</strong>. Please check back soon for online tickets for both concerts.
