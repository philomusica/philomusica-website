  - title: Spring Concert Success!
    body: |
      We thoroughly enjoyed performing Mozart's Mass in C minor and Vivaldi's Gloria in our two spring concerts. We were delighted to see so many of you in the audience for both concerts; many thanks for all of your support! We particularly enjoyed returning to Pip and Jim's in Cheltenham where we were joined by the Philomusica orchestra. The orchestra were on top form, as always, and gave an excellent performance of William Boyce's Symphony No. 1, conducted by our president and leader, Chris Horner. It was wonderful to perform to a full and appreciative audience. Many thanks, as always, to Linda for conducting us, and to all our soloists!

      Our next concerts will be in the autumn, which will include performances of Haydn's <i>Nelson</i> Mass, the prologue to Elgar's <i>The Apostles</i> and John Saunders' <i>Te Deum</i>. Please keep your eyes peeled for posters and tickets, and we look forward to seeing you there!
