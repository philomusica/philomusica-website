      We finished 2025 with an excellent Christmas concert and were so pleased to see so many of you there to support us! We are back following the Christmas holidays and raring to go. This term we tackle the sublime setting of the Requiem by Maurice Duruflé, along with Vierne's Messe Solennelle. We look forward to seeing you at our performances at <strong>St Stephen's Barbourne @ 7:30pm on 14th March</strong> and at <strong>St. Philip and St. James', Cheltenham @ 7:30pm on 28th March</strong>. Please check out our [upcoming concerts page](/concerts/upcoming) for more details. Tickets will soon be available through our website.
