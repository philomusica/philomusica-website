      The first Supper Concert of 2025 will take place on <strong>Saturday 8 March @ 7:30pm</strong>. <strong>We will be entertained by Harriet Perfect (soprano), Marcus Charman (viola) and Scola Cantorum Choral Scholar Jamie Richardson (baritone and piano)</strong>. All are excellent performers so we should have a great evening of musical entertainment. The concert will take place, as usual, in <strong>York Barn, Tredington GL20 7BP</strong> (not far from Tewkesbury). Those who have attended the previous concerts will know that it’s a super venue and there’s ample parking. As ever, all proceeds will go to Philo funds. 
      
      Tickets cost a modest £10 to include supper and your first drink. Available now from Linda, either at rehearsal or through our [contact page](/contact).
      
      <strong>There are still some seats available for this concert, so book quickly to avoid disappointment!</strong>
