      We are excited to announce two more Supper Concerts for 2025.

      On Saturday 27 September, the artists will be Dee Smithson (soprano), Ralph Barnes (tenor) and Deb Coleman (bassoon).

      On 15 November we will be entertained by Gloucester's answer to the Three Tenors - Kathryn Jeffree (soprano), Catherine Perfect (alto) and Catherine Sawyer (soprano)

      Both concerts will be given in the usual venue, York Barn, Tredington,  GL20 7BP, about 3 miles from Tewkesbury. As you’ll know if you’ve attended one of these evening before, it is a beautiful venue and there is plenty of parking. Tickets are £10, which includes the concert, supper and a glass of wine. These concerts are great fun and all proceeds go to Philo funds.

      Early booking is strongly advised for both of these events. You can request tickets through our [contact page](/contact).
