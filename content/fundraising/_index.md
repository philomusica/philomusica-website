      Our next supper concert will take place on 10th May at 7:30pm. We will be entertained by Sam Thomas, Gaye Boggon and 14 year old cornet player, Bertie Barzilla. The concert will take place, as usual, in <strong>York Barn, Tredington GL20 7BP</strong> (not far from Tewkesbury). Tickets are Â£10, which includes the concert, supper and a glass of wine. It promises to be an exciting and varied programme. If you would like a ticket, please [contact us](/contact) or speak to Linda at rehearsal.

      We look forward to seeing you there!
